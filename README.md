Centaur - JavaBean / Google App Engine Integration
=======

Centaur is a lightweight library to more closely align traditional Java Development with Google App Engine.  In particular, this utility provides functionality to seamlessly store and retrieve JavaBeans to and from Google's DataStore, so you don't have to worry about the conversion.


Naming
=======

A centaur is a mythological creature with the head, arms, and torso of a human and the body and legs of a horse.  In the case of this project, the head, arms and torso are JavaBeans (as they are intuitive and straight forward), and the body and legs (because they are lean, strong, and fast) are Google App Engine.
